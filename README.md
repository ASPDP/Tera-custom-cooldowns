# Tera-custom-cooldowns
TCC is a replacement for some of the TERA Online UI elements. At the moment it includes:
  - skill cooldowns bar (main feature)
  - character info window (hp, mp, level, item level, class, laurel)
  - custom boss hp bar
  - Harrowhold phase 1 specific gauges, showing all 4 dragons at once
  - 3 rows buff bar
 
The application is still in early stage of development, there are bugs and there may be performance issues.
